        <p>Animals coexist with us the human beings under one ecosystem on the planet. The word of cohabitation is often
            employed
            with unrealistic idealism, but the coexistence is my most natural way of seeing. The relationship between us
            and animals
            is not friendly; just as other children are called “your friends” in a kindergarten, we are not always on a
            good term
            with animals, but at least it is impossible to perfectly exclude the influence which they and we have on
            each other, and
            it is not allowed to behave totally selfishly also as in a kindergarten.</p>
        <p>I see a news show in the morning always introduce a video of a pet with funny behavior, being watched with
            smiling by
            the commentators at the studio, and I have already got tired of it. Pet is quite grotesque in that humans
            projects their
            idle on actually living animals instead of treating them as others with which they share the room for
            living. It means
            that they are insensible of interaction between the human race and other races. Some might refute that
            loving their pets
            is quite normal in that they form a friendship in living with their pets. This argument is reasonable
            enough, actually.
            Nevertheless, I personally will never be willing to form the relationship in which animals are regarded as
            to be
            protected like a baby and the growth of animals in their own way is ignored.</p>
        <p>Some moral vegetarians claim that having a pet while eating animal meat is paradoxical and I totally agree
            with it. To
            pet animals is out of social relationships in nature, which consist of food-chain and ecosystem, and this
            prioritization
            of humans’ perspectives is as if they were trying to become a god, who can objectify the entire world.</p>
        <p>In the long history of humanity, it was already normal to take an animal as their companion of hunting. The
            difference
            from the pets in modernity is that ancient humans and animals were in mutualistic symbiosis while modern
            humans deprive
            pets of animal lifework, which forms the dignity of life. Today, when mistress system in the harm is
            condemned, how can
            we still justify our deal of animals just as a pet?</p>
        <p>In fact, in the modernity where humans have overwhelming competence, the idea of interaction between human
            beings and
            animals in the same ecosystem is not easy to apply the real world, especially the visible one. Taking it
            into
            consideration, the appearance of a new way of relationship, that is petting, is convincing enough. I believe
            that the
            religious views of our ethnicity have survived in a particular form, while weakened through modernization
            and spread of
            national Shintoism. Society is hardly sensitive to those remained perspectives regrettably, but they stay
            here and there
            in a various form and therefore I was able to find them. In conclusion, they are resistant to pets, which is
            particular
            to modern society.</p>

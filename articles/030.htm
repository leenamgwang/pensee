        <p>English is in Japan, like in most of the other non-anglophone countries, a symbol of sophistication. On
            the other hand, it is the most familiar, universal, mediocre foreign language seen everywhere written in
            a adorable small alphabets beneath its Japanese equivalent. English serves thus as a multiple-levelled
            media between the ego and the external world. Since English is essentially exogenous ― in fact as much
            as is Japanese because no one has language without environmental acquisition ―, it works as a objective
            telescope to unearth myself inapparent in my daily life in Japanese. As long as the language level do
            not surpass the mean of native speakers, my ideas in English have a prematurity, while its sophisticate
            position support the intelligence of my thoughts. This ambiguity is adorable like that of a prodigy. I
            do not mean that I was so, but rather my discussion is abstract, freed from personality and applicable
            for everyone who has their own English world. Since English texts are itself the object rather than a
            media of communication in most cases in Japan, in which English is a subject of evaluation, the content
            of English is rejected to myself. Therefore the use of English is narcissistic and closed in myself, and
            English world are tranquil without exogeneous intervention, just as a prodigy is in fact banal in the
            world and special only in a narrow region. It is difficult to spend a life without hearing commercial
            appeals asserting the utility of English as a way of global communication, but in reality, it is a way
            to recognize myself rather. How interesting and pleasurable, isn’t it?</p>

            <p>I want to always keep more leeway on anything. It’s just because it’s cool. But having leeway is not an
                easy matter to tackle. Then how? It’s always a good solution to have a meta-thinking when reflecting on
                a complicated
                affair. From an analytic approach, leeway can be dissolved into three kinds.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="cnt">
            <h3>financial leeways</h3>
            <p>Lack of money is one of the simplest causes of losing leeway. It leads to disappointment and a lowering
                of
                self-esteem,
                and it’ll be more difficult to get over a financial loss caused by one’s mistake.</p>
            <p>In addition, a financial burden in a financially unaffordable time will increase the estimation in
                exchange
                for the
                payment unconsciously to convince oneself of the justification of the cost under a financial pinch. Too
                high
                expectations may bring about letdown and frustration towards the surroundings.</p>
            <p>To tackle this problem, the simplest solution is to earn more money. If it’s difficult, it’s important to
                think about
                the plan for using money again. Is that saving really urgent now? Do you not expect to earn money more
                easily when
                having got older? Does that tight use of funds not let you lose something more precious? These
                reflections
                might work.</p>
            <h3>temporal leeways</h3>
            <p>Too many tasks pressure everyone. And they make people less tolerant. As well, just like in the case of
                money, precious
                time in a busy schedule will increase positive anticipation about this matter, being the inception of
                disappointment.</p>
            <p>To address this problem, it’s effective to reconsider what you really want to do. Besides, it also works
                well
                to think
                about the significance of a one-day disturbance of your routine.</p>
            <p>Time and money are similar. You can waste both of them. It’s actually also important to truncate the
                cause
                depriving you
                of leeway and use it for what you really want to do. Even if you finally decide to do something
                reluctant
                after thinking
                of truncation, you’ll be more responsible for your autonomous decision rather than criticising yourself
                or
                your
                neighbours.</p>
            <h3>physical leeways</h3>
            <p>Fatigue and hunger are main reasons for selfishness. Train your body, then you’ll be more able to care
                for
                others even
                at the end of the day. Be conscious that your selfishness is derived from starvation, and you’ll be
                ashamed
                of your wild
                and naïve nature.</p>
            <h3>mental leeways</h3>
            <p>When doing what you are not really good at, but you think it’s supposed to do, you might require it for
                others, too.
                This will be a cause for frustration towards others, too. Getting more competent about what you’re doing
                and
                being more
                content with how you are now are the two aspects of the solution. As well, meta-thinking is also
                efficient
                for mental
                issues, too, because it’s a matter of thoughts. By being aware that losing leeway is evidence of your
                shortage of
                competence, you might feel embarrassed with your frustration towards others.</p>
            <p>Another solution is being proud of your excellency. Though it’s ideal to treat everyone equally, like
                when
                with a child,
                you might face a situation where you’re actually superior in caring or management. In fact, since it’s
                impossible that
                everyone has an equivalent degree of excellence, you are actually always superior to your friends at
                some
                point and also
                inferior at another point. Arrogance might raise the possibility of a pardon.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Though being tolerant sounds altruistic, actually when expressed as the extent of leeway, it owes to your
                self-recognition, decision and capabilities. As well as training yourself and improving your background,
                being conscious
                and responsible for them all will free you from blaming others and reproaching yourself and will allow
                you
                to maintain
                more leeway to keep a good relationship with others.</p>

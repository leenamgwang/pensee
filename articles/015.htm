        <p> The human race has always pursued stillness. We can easily find anywhere a legend of medicine for
            eternal life. One of the significant themes of the Renaissance was harmony, which put everything in
            order. It is easy to find more examples of our respect and admiration for quiet infinity. The episode
            below is among them.</p>
        <p>Today, I was staying in the library to prepare for the exams. The library always gives me relief and
            motivation, so I like staying there. In particular, I love the seats by the windows. Through the open
            window glasses, natural light abundantly clarifies the space. The light, however, is not a direct
            emission from the sun. Being mysterious, the quality of light seems to be always homogenous regardless
            of the weather and the time. I imagine that it is the success of the architect's design. Since the
            reading seats find themselves at a semi-underground level, the ray undergoes a path of the complex
            structure, as the designer probably intended. Thanks to that idea, I can always enjoy transparent
            luminosity at a seat. Today was not an exception. I did not hesitate to choose a widow-side seat and put
            off all my bag and coat as usual. Nonetheless, after opening the textbook and the notebook, I found
            myself unclear at thinking at that time, and thus I could not concentrate on the tasks. I was dully
            looking out the point of view from the windows instead. I can see a concrete wall and some plants. The
            plants were difficult to describe since they had no rarities. They seemed to be found anywhere. A child
            told to draw a tree would sketch as they looked. The concrete was also uncharacteristic. Even the sky
            looked normal. The blue mixed with a spoonful of white was all mediocre. If I were to find an irregular
            point deliberately, the perfect normality itself would be extraordinary. In my idea, this natural
            banality is yet under the creator's expression. The trees were evergreen, that is, they do not change
            according to seasons. Without any doubt, this chestnut is a translation of the building artist's desire
            for infinite stableness. I appreciate their expression. First of all, the interior of the library is a
            space that guides me to the world of eternity. In other words, the era and the period are all obscure if
            I step into the library. Books tell a story even after their author's demise. Surrounded by uncountable
            diachronic speeches of literal works, I take advantage of euphoria to lose the sense of time. In short,
            literature frees me from the finiteness of the academic term. I treasure the library in this sense. In
            evaluating it, we can find that the window-side zone's visual consistency supports the benefit of the
            library. Thus reflecting on the view from the seat, I found my task also stayed still unaccomplished.
        </p>
        <p>It is another thing that life is beautiful because it does not last forever. Exciting moments are glory
            because it is precious. Then why the humanity long infinity? It is deductible that we envy what we do
            not have: immortality. In addition, each slice of memory is a fixed still picture. Memories are often
            better than the real world because they are extractions from the beauties in the past actuality.
            Therefore we might dream of a point of time as the best scene, which never changes.</p>

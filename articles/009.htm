        <p>Recently I have not posted any article, so I decided to write something, though I do not have a good
            topic I want to talk about in particular. Probably it will be what they call a diary. Actually, I
            created my Twitter account to record my daily events and feelings, so I intend to use Twitter as a
            diary. So it might be that I do not have to write something more here as a diary. However, freed from
            the limitation of letters that Twitter imposes, I can possibly express myself in a different aspect.
            Anyway, I start composing a passage.</p>
        <p>First of all, dairy is what we write once a day. In a diary, we reflect on the highlights of each day,
            which moved their heart. In this procedure, actually, I found that reflection is an indispensable
            process, which makes it special to keep a diary. Reflecting and pointing out, it is a series of tasks to
            give a frame to my chaos of memory. To precise my preferences and distinguish them from others. It is a
            violent act, and therefore it makes me feel a kind of comfort.</p>
        <p>For example, <i>Sarashinanikki</i> (更級日記), which is among my favourite classics, is written when the
            author gets aged enough. It is marvellous for her to express her feelings lively even after decades of
            years passed and she finds her young days differently. However, the importance of reflection was a clue
            to the value of the book, too, in that they represent several perspectives whose plurality was realised
            by the passing of time.</p>
        <p>Twitter, to which I post my thoughts at a moment, might be similar to shílù (實錄), which records all the
            behaviours and discourses of the king or of the general. I find it interesting to be in charge of the
            recording bureaucrat for my own shílù, reminding a concept of freed individuals, and you?</p>
        <p>Anyway, I sometimes see some blogs which tell about the writer’s recent with some citation for their
            tweets. It might be a similar way to that of Sugawara no Takasue no musume’s (菅原孝標女), the author of
            <i>Sarashinanikki</i>. Researchers say that she called back her memories, picking up the letters and
            poems which she sent and received in her youth. Twitter’s role as a shílù might be, combined with
            reflecting blog service, a good tool to introduce plurality to my memory, which makes my path more
            interesting.
        </p>
        <p>Well, at the beginning of this article, I declared to write a diary, but I actually wrote ABOUT a diary.
            However, I leave it not rewritten on purpose since it provoked my thoughts on writing a diary as well as
            tweets. Since I find it meaningful, I might be going to write a real diary next time, if I will be
            feeling like doing so.</p>
